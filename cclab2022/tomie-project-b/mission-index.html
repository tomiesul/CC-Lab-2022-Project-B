                    Nowadays ecological global issues are significantly relevant. Scientists are worried whether the world is going to experience new ecological catastrophes in the future. The ecological activists are doing everything they can to somehow help the Earth to breathe, which overall is an essential basis for my project. The city I come from is known for its industrial sites and companies. Their work makes the air quality here worsen every year with the absolutely harmful consequences, such as the increase of the oncological diseases. During the last couple of months, the government of my hometown is trying to make a positive influence on this problem by organizing more parks and planting more trees, which inspired me to make not only enjoyable, but also a useful game using Javascript and HTML. I am planning on creating an interactive website with a game, where a user can plant a garden with various choices of plants and trees. Once the garden will have 10 plants or more, one tree will be planted by me in our local park. Therefore, showing that everyone can make a difference by just clicking and playing the game. I will try to create a system where it will be possible to have a counter of trees planted in the game and then post a report for each tree planted in real life in the form of the YouTube videos.
